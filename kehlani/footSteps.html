      <u>footsteps</u>
    </h1>
    <p> The songs sings about what kind of foot steps she has to follow and what path she wants to go in but not just that alone she also takes about her problems and how
      she had to wake away this is a lyric in the sing i liked "And when I walk away I left footsteps in the mud" thats a deep line to me. </p>
